            <p class="subsectiontag small-text">The term "education" originates from the Latin words educare, meaning
                "to bring up," and educere, meaning "to bring forth." The definition of education has been explored by
                theorists from various fields. Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like the
                transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. However, extensive debate surrounds its precise
                nature beyond these general features. One approach views education as a process occurring during events
                such as schooling, teaching, and learning. Another perspective perceives education not as a process but
                as the mental states and dispositions of educated individuals resulting from this process. Furthermore, the
                term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions
                involved in teaching and learning. Having a clear understanding of the term is crucial when attempting
                to identify educational phenomena, measure educational success, and improve educational practices.

                integral part of human society. Lack of education gives birth to numerous social problems like poor
                health, conflicts, and poor living standards. Education helps people overcome all problems by finding
                better solutions. </p>

            <p class="subsectiontag small-text">Education is the pathway for a nationâ€™s progress. Education is the
                backbone of society. The government should take all measures to provide education to every individual of
                the country. This will bring equality among people and when people improvise their way of living, they
                become more responsible towards society. The literacy rate of more developed nations is also high, and
                the literacy of every nation depends upon its education system. The government undoubtedly has made laws
                and formulated schemes, but implementing those schemes is a major task. The government, along with co-operation with the citizens, should make the society and nation a better
                place to live in. The growth of every nation depends upon the kind of population it has. A well-educated
                population will make a well-developed nation.
